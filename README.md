# ContadorSomaDados
Tools for a Physics Lab to generate a normal distribution with dices. Plus a software to control them.

SomadeDadosGenerator is only generating random numbers for five "virtual dices", summing them and displaying the total count to the user.
These data were later used to verify the existence of a normal distribution (bell curve) even on pseudo-randomic alghoritms.

ContadorSomadeDados is a GUI program also made in C#, used as a tool in one of the physics laboratory to help the team have better control
over the experiment. In this specific case, the sum of five six-faced dices thrown at a table.
